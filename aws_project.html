<h1>Software Developer Intern</h1>
<p>During my internship, I wrote clean and optimized code based on feature specifications and developed interactive user interfaces, ensuring a seamless user experience. I was actively involved in prioritizing and executing tasks throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC), collaborating closely with the team to meet project goals.</p>

<p>I also worked on designing database architectures, ensuring data integrity and optimized performance. Through rigorous testing and debugging of Java applications, I validated software functionality and security, reinforcing best practices in software development.</p>

<p>This experience helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills, gain practical exposure to software engineering principles, and enhance my ability to develop robust and scalable cloud-based solutions.</p>
